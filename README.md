# Smol-Tabbies

Once upon a time, a bunch of stray tabby kittens got very curious, so they jumped up on an office table and started pressing buttons on the keyboard. After  rolling over the desk, chasing the computer mouse, and falling asleep, they heard there was some sort of "Jam" and wanted to eat it.
